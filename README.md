## Abstract
The elderly population is frequently subjected to abandonment and isolation, either through
living independently or in the company of others who are often absent from their home
environment. This state of affairs is precarious and constant, for it exposes them to the possibility
of falling and not receiving prompt assistance. Research has revealed that the effects of not
receiving medical attention after a fall pose a greater danger to the elderly than the physical
impact of the fall itself. Timely intervention after a fall incident can prevent fatal outcomes in the
elderly population. In the current century, smartphones have become ubiquitous and permeated
all demographic segments, from metropolitan cities to rural villages and from teenagers to senior
citizens, resulting in widespread ownership. All standard smartphones are equipped with an
accelerometer, which can be leveraged to capture acceleration data and, subsequently, to detect
falls. This paper introduces two distinct methodologies for fall detection utilising accelerometer
data, one based on a neural network and the other on decision trees. We present a comprehensive
comparative analysis of both approaches to determine their strengths and limitations.
